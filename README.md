# YGOPro Card Database #
This repository serves as a text based representation with version control of the YGOPro `card.cdb` file. It includes set labeled seperated id game id/serial number list which may be used to systematically query a given `card.cdb` for seed data, and then allow that data to be updated via text editing of SQL commands. The data is then re-entered into YGOPro Salvation's `card.cdb` as SQL commands server side propigating the updated information to duelist.

## Goals ##
- Create a list of all sets and the id numbers in those sets.
- Add setcode information
- Add alias information for alternate card art
- Build automated server rebuild system
- Start building support for other languages
